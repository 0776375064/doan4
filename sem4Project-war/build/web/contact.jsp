                <h2><a href="#1-introduction" id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2> 
                <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify!</p> 
                <p>At Spotify, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service. To do this we need to understand your streaming habits so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. Your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.</p> 
                <p>That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy ("Policy") will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.</p> 
                <h2><a href="#2-about-this-policy" id="2-about-this-policy">2. About this Policy</a></h2> 
                <p>This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Spotify USA Inc. The Policy applies to all Spotify services and any associated services (referred to as the 'Spotify Service'). The terms governing your use of the Spotify Service are defined in our <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> (the "Terms and Conditions of Use").</p> 
                <p>From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any material change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information or additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.</p> 
                <p>The aim of this Policy is to:</p>

                <h2><a href="#3-your-rights-and-your-preferences-giving-you-choice-and-control" id="3-your-rights-and-your-preferences-giving-you-choice-and-control">3. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control</a></h2> 
                <p>The General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we are happy to offer transparency and access controls to help users take advantage of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:</p> 
                <ul> 
                    <li>Right of access - the right to be informed of, and request access to, the personal data we process about you;</li> 
                    <li>Right to rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;</li> 
                    <li>Right to erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;</li> 
                    <li>Right to restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;</li> 
                    <li>Right to object -</li> 
                    <li> 
                        <ul> 
                            <li>the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;</li> 
                            <li>the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;</li> 
                        </ul> </li> 
                    <li>Right to data portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party's service; and</li> 
                    <li>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>In order to enable you to learn more about these rights, exercise these rights with ease, and record your preferences in relation to how Spotify uses your personal data, we provide the following resources:</p> 
                <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Privacy Settings</strong> (accessed via your account page) - allows you to exercise choices about the processing of certain personal data, and an automated 'Download your data' function to download basic account and usage information.</li> 
                    <li><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/privacy">Privacy Center</a> - provides a convenient central location where you can find more information about how Spotify uses your personal data, your rights in relation to your personal data, and how to exercise those rights.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Notification Settings</strong> (accessed via your account page) - allows you to choose which marketing communications you receive from Spotify. You may toggle these settings to opt in or out of receiving different types of email and push notifications. Please note that email marketing messages from Spotify include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself (e.g. an unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you). Clicking on the link in an email will opt you out of further messages of that category (e.g. Artist Updates). You can use the Notification Settings page to exercise choices about all categories of email and push marketing communication.</li> 
                    <li><a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a> - provides more information on how we use cookies, including for interest-based advertising. You will also find information about how you can manage your cookie preferences and opt-out of certain types of tracking; and</li> 
                    <li><strong>Customer Support resources</strong> - We have several pages on our customer support site which provide further guidance about data protection questions. A key source of information is the Data Rights and Privacy Settings article which includes answers to "frequently asked questions" about personal data processing in the Spotify Service.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the 'Contact Us' form on the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/privacy">Privacy Center</a>. If you have concerns around our processing of your personal data, we hope you will continue to work with us to resolve them. However, you can also contact and have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swedish Data Protection Authority (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) or your local Data Protection Authority.</p> 
                <p>Additional privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) can be found in our supplemental policy <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/california-privacy-disclosure/">"Additional California Privacy Disclosures"</a>, which contains supplemental disclosures relating to the processing of your personal data.</p>
